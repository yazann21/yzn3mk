# HyPixelic/mineflayer (Hyflayer)

> [!CAUTION]
> Using Mineflayer and an Minecraft Account to log into Hypixel as a Bot violates Hypixels [Terms of Service](https://hypixel.net/terms).<br/> This may get your Minecraft Account banned if abused for non chat related things that give you an unfair advantage.

## ✨ Quick Start

[`npm`](https://npmjs.com/) » `npx jsr add @hypixelic/mineflayer`<br/>
[`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) » `pnpm dlx jsr add @hypixelic/mineflayer`<br/>
[`bun`](https://bun.sh/) » `bunx jsr add @hypixelic/mineflayer`

```TS
import mineflayer from "mineflayer";
import { HyFlayer, Bot as HyFlayerBot } from "@hypixelic/mineflayer"

// The following type trickery is needed as mineflayer isn't really type compatible.

// @ts-expect-error
const bot = mineflayer.createBot({
  host: "hypixel.net",
  username: "MICROSOFT_ACCOUNT_EMAIL",
  auth: "microsoft",
  version: "1.8.9",
}) as HyFlayerBot

// @ts-expect-error
bot.loadPlugin(HyFlayer);

bot.on("HYFLAYER_GUILD_CHAT", (event) => {
  /*
  On every Message sent in the Guild Chat you will now receive an Event Object structured like below:
  {
    "UUID":"14727faefbdc4aff848cd2713eb9939e",
    "username":"Pixelic",
    "message":"Hey",
    "timestamp":1742216120
  }
  */
});
```
